Create Interactive Images for Your Site That Empowers Publishers and Bloggers


== Description ==

ImageLinks is a WordPress plugin that lets you tag your images with any web content, so making them more interactive. Using this plugin, you can take any image and tag it with practically any web hosted content, such as hyperlinks to webpages, albums hosted on photo services, videos (YouTube, Vimeo etc) and countless other things. Basically, if an online hosted digital content has a unique URL, chances are that you can tag it on your image using this plugin. It also features rich previews of the tagged media. This means that if you want to watch a YouTube video tagged on an image, you can do it directly on the image, without having to even open up YouTube. It's similar to [thinglink service](https://www.thinglink.com/). Use this plugin to create interactive news photography, infographics, imagemap, product map and floor map and shoppable product catalogs in minutes!

Using **[imagelinks id="123"]** shortcode, you can publish an interactive image on any Page or Post in your WordPress sites.
